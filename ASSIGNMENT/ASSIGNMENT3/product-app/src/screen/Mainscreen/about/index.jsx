            <span className="About-history">
              Asus was founded in Taipei in 1989[14] by T.H. Tung, Ted Hsu,
              Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,[15] all four having previously worked
              at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to
              establish a leading position in the computer-hardware business.
              Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more
              established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies
              would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received
              their engineering prototypes. According to company history, Asus
              created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, but it had
              to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus
              approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself
              had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's
              problem and it turned out that Asus' own motherboard worked
              correctly without the need for further modification. Since then,
              Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its
              competitors.[16][17] In September 2005, Asus released the first
              PhysX accelerator card.[18] In December 2005, Asus entered the LCD
              TV market with the TLW32001 model.[19] In January 2006, Asus
              announced that it would cooperate with Lamborghini to develop the
              VX laptop series.[20] On 9 March 2006, Asus was confirmed as one
              of the manufacturers of the first Microsoft Origami models,
              together with Samsung and Founder Technology.[21] On 8 August
              2006, Asus announced a joint venture with Gigabyte Technology.[22]
